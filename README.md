There are 5 levels in this game. Each level has 6 rounds. The reward at each level is a hidden picture. The pictures are hidden behind 6 blocks; after each round is played, one block is removed. You will also earn points as you correctly represent and solve the problems.  
In each level, you are given a word problem. Your task is to represent the problem situation using 3 representations (game board, bar model, number sentence) and then to calculate the answer. 
Game Board: This is Gleebâ€™s garden. To collect fruits, click on each fruit one by one OR click on the arrows to collect fruits in groups of 6 (top arrows) or 10 (arrows on the left side of the board). You can click again to undo your action. At this stage, your task is to represent the problem situation. For example, if the problem tells that 9 fruits are collected, the game board should have 9 soil pieces and 51 blue fruits. 
Before proceeding to the next stage, click on the check icon on the right to check your answer. If you are correct on the first try, you will earn 1 point.
